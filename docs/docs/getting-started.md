# Getting started

The fastest way to run kawa is the bundled Docker Compose setup, which starts a Kafka
broker and a gateway. The gateway boots **empty**: no virtual topics are configured and
RBAC is **default-deny**, so nothing can be produced or consumed until dynamic config is
applied (see [Dynamic config](/docs/configuration#dynamic-config)).

## Prerequisites

- Docker (with Compose v2)
- Kafka command-line tools, including `kafka-console-producer.sh` (available on
  your `PATH`)

## Run the demo stack

```bash
make up
```

This always rebuilds the gateway image and force-recreates the containers, so code and
config changes are picked up reliably. (A plain `docker compose up` can silently keep
running a stale image or container.) The SASL-enabled variant is `make up-sasl`; see
`make help` for the full list of targets.

This starts three services:

| Service | Image | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `kafka` | `apache/kafka-native:4.3.1` | `19092` on the host (inspection only) |
| `kafka-init` | `apache/kafka:4.3.1` | creates the physical topic `orders-v2`, then exits |
| `gateway` | built from this repo's Dockerfile | `9092` — **connect your clients here** |

The gateway is mounted with [`docker/gateway.yaml`](https://GITHUB_URL/blob/main/docker/gateway.yaml),
which carries only startup-only settings:

- a listener on `0.0.0.0:9092`
- an upstream cluster pointing at `kafka:9092`
- an advertised listener at `localhost:9092`
- an admin API on `0.0.0.0:8080`

Virtual topics, RBAC, client authentication and governance are not in this file — they
are dynamic (see [Dynamic config](/docs/configuration#dynamic-config)).

## Configure a virtual topic and produce through the gateway

The `orders.eu` virtual topic no longer ships in the static config. Configure virtual
topics at runtime — via the admin API or by writing a config-topic snapshot (see
[Admin API](/docs/configuration#admin-api)). This maps `orders.eu` to the physical topic
`orders-v2` created by `kafka-init`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/topics \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type": "virtual", "name": "orders.eu", "topic": "orders-v2"}'
```

Because RBAC is **default-deny** and client auth is empty on first boot, producing also
needs grants. The following creates a PLAIN client with broad demo access:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/auth/clients/alice \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mechanism":"PLAIN","password":"secret"}'
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/rbac/roles/allow-all \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"acls":[{"resource":{"type":"TOPIC","pattern":"","patternType":"PREFIXED"},"operation":"ALL"},{"resource":{"type":"GROUP","pattern":"","patternType":"PREFIXED"},"operation":"ALL"},{"resource":{"type":"CLUSTER"},"operation":"ALL"}]}'
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/rbac/groups/demo \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"clients":["alice"],"roles":["allow-all"]}'
```

For a Kafka CLI running on the host, create client properties:

```bash
cat > /tmp/kawa-client.properties <<'EOF'
security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="alice" password="secret";
EOF
```

Then point the Kafka client at `localhost:9092` (the advertised address in
`docker/gateway.yaml`) and use the virtual topic name:

```bash
# Produce to the VIRTUAL topic via the gateway
kafka-console-producer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --command-config /tmp/kawa-client.properties \
  --topic orders.eu <<'EOF'
{"orderId": "1", "region": "eu"}
EOF
```

```bash
# The cluster only ever sees the PHYSICAL topic; orders.eu is virtual
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --list
# -> orders-v2   (orders.eu never existed on the cluster)
```

## Run the gateway without Docker

Build the shaded fat jar and point it at a config file:

```bash
./mvnw -pl kawa-server -am package
java -jar kawa-server/target/kawa-server-*.jar --config path/to/config.yaml
```

If `--config` is omitted, kawa looks for `config.yaml` in the working directory.

## Verify it works

With the stack running, connect any Kafka tool to `localhost:9092`. Metadata requests
return a single broker — the gateway itself — advertising `localhost:9092`, so every
subsequent connection also lands on kawa instead of the real cluster.
