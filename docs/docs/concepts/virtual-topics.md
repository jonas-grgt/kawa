# Virtual topics

Virtual topics let clients use **logical topic names** while the cluster only ever
sees **physical topics**. The gateway rewrites names in both directions, request and
response, for every API it decodes.

```yaml
virtualTopics:
  orders.eu:          # logical name — what clients see
    topic: orders-v2  # physical name — what exists on the cluster
```

## What the client experiences

- A producer sends to `orders.eu`; kawa rewrites the Produce request to `orders-v2`
  before forwarding.
- Metadata requests never list `orders-v2`. Instead, the physical entry is renamed to
  its logical name in place — from the client's view, `orders.eu` is a normal topic
  with real partitions and leaders.
- Consumers subscribe to `orders.eu` and receive records as if nothing happened;
  Fetch requests are rewritten to `orders-v2` under the hood.

Set `exposePhysicalTopic: true` if you *do* want the physical topic to remain listed
alongside its logical name in Metadata responses (hidden by default).

## Covered operations

Rewriting is not limited to produce/consume. Per-API transforms handle topic names in:

- Produce / Fetch / ListOffsets
- Metadata (renaming + hiding)
- OffsetCommit / OffsetFetch / OffsetDelete / DeleteRecords
- FindCoordinator, AddPartitionsToTxn, TxnOffsetCommit, DescribeTransactions
- CreateTopics / CreatePartitions / DeleteTopics
- DescribeConfigs / AlterConfigs / IncrementalAlterConfigs
- ACL operations (Create/Describe/Delete)
- Fetch session bookkeeping (`FetchSessionRegistry`) so incremental fetches stay consistent

Requests for APIs without a transform pass through untouched.

## Server-side consume filters

A virtual topic can define a consume filter that drops non-matching records during
Fetch — at the gateway, before they reach the consumer:

```yaml
virtualTopics:
  orders.eu:
    topic: orders-v2
    filter:
      type: headerEquals   # keep records where header 'region' == 'eu'
      header: region
      value: eu
```

Behaviour details worth knowing:

- Filtering happens server-side using Kafka's own batch filtering
  (`MemoryRecords.filterTo`), so it is cheap and preserves record framing.
- **Offsets of surviving records are unchanged.** Dropped records leave gaps in the
  offset sequence — consumers see the same offsets they would on a compacted stream,
  which keeps offset commits and rebalances working normally.
- The filter applies per partition of the mapped physical topic; producers can still
  write everything to `orders-v2`, and each logical view filters independently.

### CEL expressions

For anything beyond a single header equality, use the `cel` filter type. It evaluates
a [CEL](https://cel.dev) expression against each record and keeps the record when the
expression is `true`:

```yaml
virtualTopics:
  orders.eu:
    topic: orders-v2
    filter:
      type: cel
      expression: headers.region == "eu" && value.contains("error")
```

The expression can reference `key`, `value`, `headers` (a map), and `timestamp`.
Missing headers resolve to `""`, so `headers.region == "eu"` is simply `false` when the
header is absent — use the `has(headers.region)` macro to test presence explicitly.

CEL is non-Turing-complete and evaluates in linear time, so it is safe to run on the
hot path. Expressions are compiled once and cached; only the evaluation runs per record.

## Advertised-listener rewriting

Alongside name mapping, every broker and coordinator endpoint returned to the client
(Metadata, FindCoordinator) is rewritten to kawa's [`advertised`](/docs/configuration#advertised)
endpoint. Clients therefore always talk to the gateway, never directly to a broker —
even after leader redirects.
